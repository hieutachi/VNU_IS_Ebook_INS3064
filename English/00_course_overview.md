2. **Type all code, don't copy/paste** — The only way to remember long-term.
3. **Run code immediately after each section** — See results, fix errors, experiment.
4. **Do small exercises after each section** — Reinforce knowledge.
5. **Complete worksheets** — Check understanding.
6. **Integrate into project** — Learn alongside real project.
7. **Ask when you don't understand** — Don't leave knowledge gaps.
